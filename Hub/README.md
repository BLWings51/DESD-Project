## How to run

This file contains the login session, to run this use 

```python manage.py runserver```

It should open the login page, if not it is most likely at home page. It that happens, don't worry it shows that you are logged in since so far there isn't any way to pop session and try it again.

Here are two accounts to try and test the login:

- ```test@gmail.com```
- ```newuser@example.com```

Doesn't matter which one to pick and they both have ```password``` as password. Once logged in it should direct to homepage, saying ```Welcome to homepage, you are successfully logged in```.
